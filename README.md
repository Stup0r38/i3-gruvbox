## My Preferred Applications ##
+ **Text Editor - Micro:** It's just cool and easy to use
+ **File Manager - Thunar**: One of the most lightweight gui file browser and it has very few dependencies (works better with `thunar-archive-plugin`)
+ **Archive Manager - File-roller**: It just works
+ **Web Browser - Brave-browser**: Privacy friendly browser
+ **Terminal - Alacritty**: Faster than kitty and more customizable than st
+ **Theme / Look & Feel Manager - lxappearance**: makes managing icon / cursor / application themes easy, only theme manager with no DE dependencies, and works very well
+ **Task Manager - Lxtask**: Very few dependences and super lightweight
